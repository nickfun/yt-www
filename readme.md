# Simple Youtuble Downloader

Hey it's a webapp that just shells out to `youtubedl` so I can
easily download youtube videos for watching offline.

## How do I install it?

- setup a virtualenv
- install the requirements from `requirements.txt`
- edit the `.env` file with the config you like
- `foreman start` to run it or `honcho start` (i like honcho)
